# Project Taggy
### Have your files/folders/websites cluttered? Presenting Taggy, which will let you tag anything your computer for the ease of your use.

## Features:
1. **Drag and drop** any file/folder/website from your machine to Taggy.
2. Spelling mistakes? In a hurry? Don't remember what was the exact tag name? 
Don't worry we got you covered. Enter a near meaningful gibberish :D, our recommender will show you, your **nearest possible 'saved' tag**.
3. Once a tag is saved, you could move over to 'Browse tags' to **search and locate** your file.
4. Located your file. Oh Wait! click on that file and **directly reach your destination**, even it be a website URL!
5. Want to remove a tag? Just click on your tag and click **'Remove Tag'**.
6. Did you just **change your file location or rename your file name**? Wait, we will help you locate that file on your own, without even changing your previous tag!
7. We **support Windows and Linux** as of now and that too using a **'shared memory'** in a text file. Hence, Taggy won't burden your computer with much memory!

## Plans in Pipeline:
1. 80-20 rule, 80% of usage will come from 20% tags and these would be our highlights to choose from. Rest can be added by you.
2. There might remain some tags with similar functions/synonymous names. However, this can be mitigated with the use of NLP algorithms where we can breakdown tags into tokens and suggest the already present similar ones.
3. Are you proud of yourself being organised? Having a feature that allows to automatically tag your files based on your filename/date of creation. We can have date of creation + filename for photos/videos. That way you can save your trip memories!
4. Multi-tagging will result in different output. For e.g: We have several photos tagged as Scientists, Monuments, India.
      - Case1: Scientists+India will result in photos of Scientists from India.
      - Case2: Monuments+India will result in photos of famous Monuments from India.
      - Case3: India will result in photos of Scientists and Monuments
5. Extending support to MacOS.
